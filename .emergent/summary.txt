The AI engineer's work involved an iterative development process for the Swayatta 4.0 CRM/ERP, addressing both new feature development and critical bug fixes. Initially, the focus was on enhancing Quotation Management (QMS) and unifying Opportunity Stage Management (L1-L8). This included significant backend API updates for QMS data, pricing, and status management, alongside a major frontend refactor to create a full-page, multi-stage opportunity form.

A significant pivot occurred when the user requested the development of a new Service Delivery (SD) Module, integrated with the existing CRM. This involved creating new backend models, APIs, and frontend components for SD, including auto-initiation from L6 opportunities, project tracking, and approval workflows. Interspersed with these feature developments were critical bug fixes, notably resolving an inability to type in the Create User form due to a field mapping error, and addressing issues with quotation display and navigation.

The current state involves resolving the latest user feedback regarding menu structure, L4 quotation approval buttons, and opportunities menu renaming, indicating a continuous cycle of refinement and feature integration.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to complete Swayatta 4.0 CRM/ERP. Initial focus was on **Enhanced Opportunity Management** (unified L1-L8 stages with 38 rules) and a full-page **Quotation Management System (QMS)**. QMS requires 14 master tables, multi-phase pricing, real-time calculations, persistence of  and , and a  selector. **Master Data Admin** supports CRUD for Products, Pricing Models, Pricing Lists, and Category Hierarchy.

Recent priorities shifted to:
1.  **Quotation Flow (L4)**: / must redirect to L4, displaying the quote immediately with correct status (Draft/Unapproved) and totals. Quotation statuses are , , .  quotes are read-only, and L5 unlocks only if at least one quote is . The Existing Quotations UI needs a clear card/table list with Quote ID, Status, Dates, Totals, and Actions (View/Edit, Approve, Delete).
2.  **L5–L8 Stage Fields & Logic**: Implement detailed fields, validations (e.g., Updated Pricing > 0), and actions for Commercial Negotiations (L5), Won (L6), Lost (L7), and Dropped (L8). Admin-only fields (CPC, Overhead) require role-gating. Complete Final Stage button on L6/L7/L8 must update opportunity status and redirect to  with a live refresh.
3.  **Service Delivery (SD) Module**: Auto-initiate SDR at L6 (Won). Provide Upcoming Projects review (read-only Opportunity/Lead/Quotation/Sales data), allowing Convert to Project or Reject Opportunity. Implement Projects for delivery tracking, Approvals for pending/completed, and Delivery Logs. All active sales opportunities (L1-L8) should be visible in Upcoming Projects.
4.  **Admin Quotation Approval**: Admins, Commercial Approvers, and Sales Managers should approve quotations from a dedicated listing page and directly within the L4 stage of Enhanced Opportunities.
5.  **Fixes**: Address issues like Create User form not allowing input, quotation edit data not loading, L5 Commercial Decision dropdown missing, incorrect L5 Save & Continue navigation, Service Delivery menu position, and Opportunities menu restructuring.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a new set of critical issues reported by the user, specifically concerning the Enhanced Opportunity Flow. The work in progress is focused on:

1.  **Service Delivery Menu Position**: The Service Delivery submenu was incorrectly rendered beneath the Sales menu. The AI has identified this in  and is in the process of moving it to be a separate top-level menu item.
2.  **Opportunities Menu Restructuring**: The Enhanced Opportunities and Opportunities submenus were both present under Sales. The AI is in the process of removing the Opportunities submenu and renaming Enhanced Opportunities to simply Opportunities in the navigation, without altering existing functionalities.
3.  **L4 Quotation Approval Buttons**: The Admin user could not approve quotations within an opportunity's L4 stage (Technical Qualification -> Existing Quotations). The issue was identified in , where the approval button's visibility check () was not correctly configured. The AI is currently working on fixing this by using the proper role checking function to ensure Approve and Reject buttons are visible and functional for authorized roles on each quotation.

The AI has just identified the root cause of the L4 approval button issue, which is the incorrect setup of  within the  component.
