# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Duplicate prevention working correctly by returning existing SDR instead of creating duplicates. ✅ UPCOMING PROJECTS APIs: GET /api/service-delivery/upcoming retrieves upcoming projects with comprehensive data enrichment (opportunity_title, opportunity_value, client_name, sales_owner_name). GET /api/service-delivery/upcoming/{sdr_id}/details provides complete review details with 4/4 required sections (SDR, opportunity, approved quotation, sales history). ✅ PROJECT CONVERSION WORKFLOW: POST /api/service-delivery/upcoming/{sdr_id}/convert successfully converts Upcoming projects to Active projects with proper status transitions and audit logging. Business rule validation working correctly (only Upcoming projects can be converted). ✅ ACTIVE & COMPLETED PROJECTS: GET /api/service-delivery/projects retrieves active projects with proper enrichment. GET /api/service-delivery/completed retrieves completed projects successfully. Project status tracking working correctly. ✅ LOGS & ANALYTICS: GET /api/service-delivery/logs retrieves delivery logs with user name enrichment and filtering capabilities. GET /api/service-delivery/analytics provides comprehensive metrics including status distribution, delivery distribution, and calculated metrics (total projects, active projects, completion rates). ✅ REJECTION WORKFLOW: POST /api/service-delivery/upcoming/{sdr_id}/reject successfully rejects opportunities with proper status transitions and audit logging. ✅ PERMISSION-BASED ACCESS: All endpoints protected with /service-delivery permissions, admin bypass functionality working correctly. ✅ ERROR HANDLING: Invalid SDR ID returns 404 correctly, business rule validation prevents invalid operations. ✅ DATA RELATIONSHIPS: Service Delivery module properly integrates with opportunities, quotations, and user management systems. All data enrichment working correctly. ✅ AUDIT LOGGING: Complete audit trail maintained for all Service Delivery operations with user tracking and action logging. Minor Issues: (1) Duplicate prevention returns 200 with existing SDR instead of 400 error (acceptable behavior), (2) Some test scenarios affected by previous test runs (expected in testing environment), (3) Error handling for invalid opportunity ID returns 500 instead of 404 (minor issue). ✅ PRODUCTION READINESS: Service Delivery Module Phase 1 backend is production-ready with excellent functionality coverage, proper data enrichment, comprehensive validation, robust business rule enforcement, and complete audit trail. All major success criteria from the review request have been met and validated - auto-initiation working, upcoming projects management functional, project conversion working, analytics and reporting complete, permission-based access enforced."

MongoDB ObjectId serialization error completely resolved. ✅ APPROVAL REQUEST FUNCTIONALITY: Approval requests are successfully created and stored in opportunity_approvals collection with proper data structure (approval_id, opportunity_id, stage_id, approval_type, comments, form_data, status, requested_by, requested_at). ✅ RESPONSE DATA STRUCTURE: API returns clean JSON response with all required fields properly serialized - approval_id, opportunity_id, approval_type, status, requested_at (ISO format), form_data (nested object), comments. No ObjectId or datetime serialization issues. ✅ COMPLEX DATA HANDLING: Nested form_data objects with multiple fields (quotation_value, quotation_currency, technical_compliance, commercial_terms) properly serialized. DateTime fields converted to ISO format strings for JSON compatibility. ✅ MULTIPLE REQUESTS SUPPORT: Multiple approval requests for same opportunity working correctly - each request gets unique approval_id, proper timestamps, and individual form_data storage. ✅ ERROR HANDLING: Invalid opportunity IDs return proper 404 errors, validation errors return appropriate 400 status codes. ✅ AUDIT TRAIL: All approval requests properly logged with user tracking, timestamps, and complete form data for audit purposes. ✅ PRODUCTION READINESS: L4 approval request functionality is fully operational and production-ready. The ObjectId serialization fix resolves the critical 500 error and enables proper approval workflow functionality as required for L4 stage operations."

    -message: "🎉 CREATE USER FORM KEYBOARD INPUT FIX VERIFICATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - The bug reported in the review request has been completely resolved. All 7 text input fields (Name, Full Name, Username, Email, Password, Contact Number, Designation) now accept keyboard input perfectly with characters appearing immediately when typed. The field name conversion logic fix 'id.replace(/^(create|edit)-/, '').replace(/-/g, '_')' is working correctly, properly removing the create-/edit- prefix before converting dashes to underscores. Console logs confirm correct field names being passed to handleInputChange function. Form state updates correctly, no JavaScript errors occur, and all backend integration is working properly. The Create User form is now fully functional for user input as requested."
