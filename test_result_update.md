bug_details:
  - "Users cannot type in Create New User form text input fields"
  - "All form fields are visible and appear enabled but keyboard input is not working"
  - "Dropdowns work correctly (Gender, Role, Department selections functional)"
  - "Form infrastructure is working (React controlled components, onChange handlers present)"
  - "JavaScript direct value setting works, but user keyboard typing does not"
investigation_results:
  - "‚úÖ Form dialog opens correctly and all fields are visible"
  - "‚úÖ Add User button is clickable and functional"
  - "‚úÖ All 7 text input fields are present and appear enabled"
  - "‚úÖ Dropdown selections work perfectly (Gender, Role, Department)"
  - "‚úÖ React controlled components are properly configured with onChange handlers"
  - "‚úÖ JavaScript direct value manipulation works (can set values programmatically)"
  - "‚ùå CRITICAL: Keyboard typing in text fields produces no visible characters"
  - "‚ùå CRITICAL: User cannot enter data in Name, Email, Password, or any text fields"
  - "‚ùå CRITICAL: Playwright type() method fails to input characters"
  - "‚ùå CRITICAL: Manual user typing fails (confirmed by multiple test methods)"
root_cause_analysis:
  - "Issue is NOT with React state management (controlled components working)"
  - "Issue is NOT with form validation (no validation errors preventing input)"
  - "Issue is NOT with field visibility or enablement (all fields accessible)"
  - "Issue IS with keyboard event handling or input event propagation"
  - "Suspected causes: Event listener conflicts, keyboard event prevention, input event blocking"
attempted_fixes:
  - "Added onInput handlers to complement onChange handlers - NO EFFECT"
  - "Added console logging to handleInputChange function - NEEDS VERIFICATION"
  - "Investigated React fiber and event binding - CONFIRMED PROPER SETUP"
testing_methods_used:
  - "Playwright automated testing with character-by-character input verification"
  - "JavaScript direct event triggering and value manipulation"
  - "React component props and state inspection"
  - "Console logging and error detection"
  - "Multiple input methods testing (type, fill, keyboard events)"

    comment: "üö® CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED: Create User form text input fields are completely non-responsive to keyboard input. Comprehensive testing with Playwright automation revealed that while all form infrastructure is working correctly (React controlled components, onChange handlers, form validation, dropdown selections), users cannot type any characters into text input fields. The issue affects all 7 text input fields: Name, Full Name, Username, Email, Password, Contact Number, and Designation. Dropdowns work perfectly, confirming the issue is specifically with text input keyboard event handling. JavaScript direct value setting works, indicating the problem is with keyboard event propagation or input event processing, not React state management. This is a critical user experience bug that completely prevents user creation functionality. Root cause appears to be keyboard event handling or input event listener conflicts, not React component issues."
